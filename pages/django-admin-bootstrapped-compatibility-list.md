abstract: To ease you in the choice of what admin theme to use

You may already know that [django-admin-bootstrapped](/bootstrap-your-django-admin-in-3-minutes/) is a Bootstrap theme for the default Django admin application.

Maybe you even know that with it you can also [translate an application name](https://github.com/riccardo-forina/django-admin-bootstrapped#translatechange-an-application-name-with-a-template), [add custom html (eg. an help section)](https://github.com/riccardo-forina/django-admin-bootstrapped#add-custom-html-to-the-change-form-of-any-model-with-a-template) to the change_list/change_form views, and [sort inlines](https://github.com/riccardo-forina/django-admin-bootstrapped#inline-sortable) with - almost - no code.

But whay you may not know is how compatible the project is with the django apps ecosystem.
