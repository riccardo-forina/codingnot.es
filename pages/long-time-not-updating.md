My last update is from February. What happened since then?

Actually, a lot of things.

## I have a new job

Now I am a Frontend Web Engineer for [Lumata](https://www.lumata.com/) for one of the main products.  
Needless to say I'm thrilled by the opportunity of focusing only on HTML, CSS and Javascript development.

Here are some of the cool stuff I work with: Angular.js, Yeoman, SASS, Agile development, GIT.

## I moved from OSX+Sublime Text to Linux+IntelliJ

Where the OSX-to-Linux switch is almost transparent - when you work mainly with a terminal, how cares about the underlying OS? - the switch from Sublime to IntelliJ is much more drastic.

Sublime is a __great__ editor with great shortcuts and life-saving tools that I still use - I'm writing this with it - but only when I need to, well, edit text.

The main culprit is Angular.js. When I started building complex applications with it I felt the need to lessen the context switches I had to deal with to focus my attention on the actual job.

Angular.js is not easy. It requires discipline, know-how and advance planning. And a stong debugging environment. Sure, Chrome Dev Tools are great, and [Batarang](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/angularjs-batarang/ighdmehidhipcmcojjgiloacoafjmpfk) is a lifesaving addition. But it's not enough. Add to this that maybe you're not only working on the Angular.js app, but on the server side part too - let it be Node.js or Python or Java, it doesn't matter - and you really really want an _editor_ that helps you on not getting lost. I needed an IDE.

My hatred for IDEs is an old story. Slow, memory starved, bloated, not visually appealing if not ugly - yes Eclipse, I'm talking with you.

IntelliJ is nothing like that. Sure, it's heavier than Sublime, but it handles **everything**. Editing, refactoring, VCS, debugging, intellisense completion that doesn't sucks, nice UI, support for everything you need. In short, is a tool built by people who _actually use it_.

Oh and yes, it reduced my number of terminal windows/tabs by an order of magnitude, which is cool since re-starting everything every time I have to switch project is taxing.

## I moved from codingnot.es to forina.me

I love codingnot.es as domain name and I'll keep it, but I desired a personal email address not related to a vendor, so the switch.

## Lastly, I'm getting married!

Obviously the wedding website has been built in-house with Python :D

That's all, I hope to write more in the future. Maybe something Yeoman related!
